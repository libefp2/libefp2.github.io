This gallery highlights the use of EFP to bridge the gap between chemistry, biology, and physics,
particularly in solving real-world challenges in drug design and photosynthesis. EFP plays a crucial
role in understanding and optimizing these complex processes by providing detailed insights into
molecular interactions.
