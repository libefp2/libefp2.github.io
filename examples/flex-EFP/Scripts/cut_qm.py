Sample execution:
    cut_qm.py ala_33_473.inp a0001.efp

This file reads in an input file and a reference EFP file that should be a good geometric match (low RMSD),
AND the .inp file has listed atoms and polarizable points that should be deleted.
Atoms that will be added to the QM region should be removed from the fragment file.
Additionally, a bridge between a QM-atom and an MM-atom that are covalently bound should have the QM atom removed,
and some information of the MM-atom should be removed. The coordinates, monopole, and screen parameter sections
for the MM-atom are retained, while the dipoles, quadrupoles, octupoles, and polarizable point sections 
should be removed.
