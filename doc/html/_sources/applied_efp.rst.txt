FMO: Applied flexible EFP
*************************

Overview
--------

As is the case with many photoactive proteins,computational methods struggle to reproduce 
experimental spectra for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex (FMO). Work by 
`Kim et al <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b03486>`_ shows that 
flexible QM/EFP can be applied to FMO to correctly generate computational results in 
quantitative agreement to experimental spectra. 

The key to applying EFP to your system is to carefully define the active site and EFP region. 
FMO is a trimeric protein with eight bacteriochloropyll a (BChl) pigments in each monomer. 
FMO completes energy transfer via excitonic couplings across these eight BChls. A summary 
of the complete workflow that was performed is the following: 1) molecular dynamics (MD) 
simiulations of the FMO protein in water and counter ions, 2) QM/MM (not EFP) geometry 
optimization of *each* active site (active sites consist of one BChl pigment and 
typically 3 H-bonding amino acids), and 3) flex-EFP excited state energy calculations of 
each pigment.

In the case of FMO, these steps must be repeated on several snapshots from MD to account 
for variation in the resting state of the structure, and the QM region must be defined 
carefully in both the QM/MM and flex-EFP stages. It might not be universally true that one 
must perform QM/MM geometry optimization. This page is a walkthrough for the flex-EFP procedure 
only. Molecular dynamics and QM/MM optimizations are assumed to be complete for your 
system prior to these steps.

You will need a structure file (.g96) and topology information (.top, for atom charges). In this specific case,
a structure file is extracted from a GROMACS molecular dynamics trajectory and all water molecules more than 15 angstroms from 
the protein's surface have been removed. For a chlorophyll-containing protein, you will likely want to optimize the geometry 
of each active chlorophyl molecule (with very close amino acids/water molecules) separately with more standard QM/MM approaches 
before proceeding with EFP calculations on the optimized geometry. For this example, the first BChl, residue number 359, 
has been optimized and will be the QM region for the EFP calcuation.

First, an EFP region must be defined. Every amino acid, (non QM) BChl, and water molecule containing an 
atom within 15 angstroms of the QM BChl headring. 

The headring is defined by atomnames: MG CHA CHB HB CHC HC CHD HD NA C1A 
C2A H2A C3A H3A C4A CMA HMA1 HMA2 HMA3 NB C1B C2B C3B C4B CMB HMB1 HMB2 HMB3 CAB OBB CBB HBB1 HBB2 HBB3 NC C1C C2C H2C C3C 
H3C C4C CMC HMC1 HMC2 HMC3 CAC HAC1 HAC2 CBC HBC1 HBC2 HBC3 ND C1D C2D C3D C4D CMD HMD1 HMD2 HMD3 CAD OBD CBD HBD CGD O1D O2D 
CED HED1 HED2 HED3

The headring surrounded by EFP region looks like this:

EFP is, of course, a fragmentation method. The protein residues within the 15 angstrom cutoff will be expressed individually. 
Because amino acids are a continuous chain, we will need to break each residue into its own fragment. Chemically, we would like 
to divide each residue by the C-C backbone bond, however, standard PDB listing convention divides residues by the C-N 
bond. To correct this, 'C' and 'O' atom names should be included in the following aminoc acid. This way the 'C' and 'CA' 
(carbonyl carbon and alpha carbon respectively) bond is the division between bonded fragments.
See the examples below:

PDB residues are divided like this:

For EFP, we would rather these two fragments
 look like this:

   :width: 400

The desired atoms are contained in the structure file, but they do not completely 'agree' with the amino acid numbering.
Below is a snippet from the structure file with the desired EFP fragment 8 highlighted. Note that atom names 'C' and 'O' 
are included in the following fragment.

   :linenos:
   :lines: 79-101
   :emphasize-lines: 10-21

Next, some of the BChl molecules are closer each other than the 15 angstrom cutoff, so they also appear in the EFP region. It is more cost efficient 
to treat BChl fragments as separate head and tail groups as is shown below:

.. image:: ../images/efp_headtail.bmp
   :width: 400
   
In the case of both amino acid and BChl fragments, we have at least one broken bond; we cannot simply compute a fragment that is 
missing an atomic bond. To solve this, we will introduce virtual hydrogen atoms to 'cap' the broken bonds. Non terminal 
amino acid fragments will have two virtual atoms. The first is between the alpha carbon of the previous residue and the 
carbonyl carbon of the current residue; the other is similarly between the alpha carbon of the current residue and the carbonyl carbon 
of the following residue. The BChl fragments are split between atoms 'C2A' and 'CAA.' One virtual atom will be added to both 
head and tail fragments between these atoms. Virtual atoms are added along the vector of the broken bonds with the distance changed 
to the C-H equilibrium bond distance, 1.09 angstroms.

Once the system is properly fragmented, we can finally run EFP calculations in the precense of the polarizable, solvatochromic environment. 

EFP Workflow
------------

Extract a single snapshot of MD extracted from GROMACS ie: ``gmx traj -f md_50.trr -s md_50.tpr -o bchl361-79002.g96``\(.g6 format).
Please note that extracting larger systems can occasionally cause columns to be misaligned due to large atom number indexes. 
This misalignemnt can make the structure appear strangely in some visualizers (most commonly VMD). Though it shouldn't matter, 
you can reformat the file with a simple script to realign the columns. `Here <../examples/flex-EFP/Scripts/format.py>`_ is an example of a script that can do this with an output file of 
``formed_bchl361-79002.g96``.

Now, we need to know which amino acids, cofactors, and water molecules constitute the EFP region. One method to find this is to
make use of the ``gmx select`` command, but this will take a small amount of footwork. You will need to create an index file 
that defines the BChl head ring group for reference in gmx selections. The code below will generate this index file with the default 
name ``index.ndx``; index.ndc contains all standard GROMACS index groups (system, protein, etc), with one final nonstandard group, 'headring'.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/flex-EFP/Scripts/gen_efp_index.sh
   :linenos:
   
Here is a visualization of atoms contained in the newly created index group:

.. image:: ../images/361_headring.bmp
   :width: 400

Note: the QM region will include the entire BChl, but the EFP region will be defined by distance to this ring group 
only.

The EFP region should be composed of all residues that contain at least one atom within 15 angstoms of the headring. 
A new .g96 can be made using the command: ``gmx select -s md_80.tpr -n index.ndx -f formed_bchl361-79002.g96 -select 'same residue as within 1.5 of group "Headring"' -on shell_index.ndx``. 
This command looks for any atom within our cutoff (1.5 because GROMACS units are in nm), then accepts every atom belonging to 
the same residue as the found atom, and adds these to the selection. The output of the command is named shell_index.ndx, which as the 
name suggests, is another index file. This file has exactly one index group that is the EFP region. 

Now, ``gmx editconf -f formed_bchl361-79002.g96 -n shell_index.ndx -o shell_bchl361-79002.g96`` will create a new structure 
file of the EFP region only. The structure should look like the 'desired EFP region' shared above on this page (in the Overview section).
