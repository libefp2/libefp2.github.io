But wait, do I need to recompute fragment parameters for each new geometry of my
polymer? Not necessary, if you did a homework. Check out this paper on
`Flexible EFP <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b04166>`_.

The original code developed by Dr. Yongbin Kim can be found
`here <https://github.com/libefp2/libefp/blob/master/tools/Flexible_V5.py>`_.

Check out our tutorial showing how to setup QM/EFP calculations for a protein
system using Flexible EFP procedure! :ref:`applied_efp`
